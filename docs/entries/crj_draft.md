# Introduction
Over the pass six weeks there has been many opertunitys to reflect on my personal and prefessional practises and explore

# Procrasteration
When i returned to university i was really struggling to get back into the swing of things affter a long summer of gaming and very little time spent on projects. I found that i was lacking insperation and would fallback to procrasternating rather than doing any work. As a knock on effect this filled me with self-doubt, dread and made me worry if i should even be doing a masters at all. In particular i was concerd with the amount of writen work that would be expective as this is somthink i genrally struggle with being dyslexic. At the time it only seemed to contrabute to the amount of procrasteration i was undertaking. Genrally i dont see myself as a procrastinator, therefor i decied it would be wise to gain a better understanding of procrasteration and to see if there are any underlining factors that can contrabute to the practise.

“Everyone procrastinates, but not everyone is a procrastinator.” -- Joseph Ferrari \cite{https://academicminute.org/2018/10/joseph-ferrari-depaul-university-procrastination/}

There a lots of thearoies for the reason behind procastornation, while many simply belive it just "lazyness" or poor time managment. However, this is offten not the case, with many sugesting that it can be casued by an underlining emotional issue \cite{https://ct.counseling.org/2019/10/procrastination-an-emotional-struggle/}. Meanwhile, in a TEDx talk by Nic Voge \cite{j1-c3}, he claims that procastornation is actually pretty predictable when you understand the dynamics of motivation. Nic believes it rooted in our self-worth rather than coping with differcult emotionals or faulty time managerment. In addition Nic talks about how it could be a form of self-protection, this way, if we get a bad result it doent mean we're not capable but rather we where too distacted to our best. This pretty much nailed it on the head for how i was feeling at the time.

“Procrastination isn’t shameful or a character flaw. Instead it’s rooted in a very human need: the need to feel competent and worthy” - Nic Voge \cite{j1-c4}

Nic makes a few suggestion to break the cycle. We should be aware of what we’re doing and get familiar with out “greatest hits” of wasting time. For me, this is mindlessly scrolling through Reddit, YouTube and the likes. Furthermore he clames we need to find a way to “tip the balance” from the "avoid" motives (reasons why not to do somthing) to the more positive "approach" motives (reasons to do somthing). Apparently procastornation can simply be put down to fears overwhelming the "approach" motives. This was very relevent to how i was feeling at the time, i was worried that there will be too much writen work, i'll fall behind and it will end in failure. Nic suggests that it can help to look at the bigger picture, remind yourself of your personal goals, objectives or missions. If its still intimidating break it down into smaller tasks.

With that said, i decided to take Nic's advice, i later reflected on my personal mission and reasioned with myself all the reasions i can achive a master degree. Furthermore, i set myself a number of challenges and goals to achive over the next week or so. I dident achive all of them but it was enough to prove to myself that i can do it. Now my procasternation rate is almost non-existent now im back into the swing of things.

# Inducing Empathy In Games
In one of our workshops we looked at rapid ideation methods and where tasked with creating a text-driven game based around 'Call and Response'. For this project we where put into groups of four and where asked to use a form of rapid ideation to come up with ideas. We decided to focus on mental health using relatable non-human characters. The idea was that the player would have to complete some activity in order to overcome a negative emotion, suggesting to the player that everthink would work out in the end.

I was fully supportive of the idea as i struggled with my own mental health during the first two covid lockdowns. I personaly feel that this gave us a chance to explor some of theses emotions that many felt during that time. Therefor, giving us the perfect oppertunity to induce empathy on the player. However, somwhere along the lines we lost the message that we where trying to get across which resulted in the project becoming a bit of a flop. 

In a later workshop we where given a pice to read, for our group we where given "Designing games to foster empathy" by J Belman et al \cite{j3-c1}. It was extreamly relevent for the project that we where currently working on and has given me a number of considerations for a personal project i would like to work on in the furture. The paper itself contained a wealth of imformation relating to many different area of research into empathy. It follows by making a sevral sugestion on how to incorperate different aspects of empathy into games.

J Belman and M. Flanagan suggest that players are more likely to be empathetic if it is introduced from the offset of the game. However, if the attemp is ineffective it will result in most players playing the game “unempathetically”. Furthermore they popose that players should be given specific recommendations in relation to the solution to the issues represented. They clam that this should be decided on a case-by-case basis, whether an iconic (ie. an icon hovering over a non-playable character (NPC)) or true-to-life (ie. accurate moderling of NPCs) representation is used. Continuing that, they suggest that short burst of emotional empathy works well if desired outcomes are inline with beliefs about themselves in relation to the world. 

I fell that if we had implermented some of the suggestions made by J Belman et all we would of had a much better chance of inducing empathy on the player. With that said, iv learned a lot from reading the paper, which has given me some new things to consider when designing games. The methods suggested will be feed through into furture project as empathy can play an imporent role in vedio games.  

# Project Managment
During the 'Call and Responce' assignment, we further failed to design and manager our project correctly. In the first couple of days we discussed out ideas as a team which gave us a brief concept for the artifact that we would like to build. During these discussions we simply just jotted down some notes, went our seprate ways and started to work on the game. At no point during our disscussions did we decide to turn our notes into a concrete plan in the form of a game design document (GDD) nor did we use any tools to track our progress in the form of a scrum board \cite{SCRUM_BOARD}. This was not very agile \cite{AGILE} of us.

In group projects i offten advoid taking on the lead role esspililly if im not the idea holder. Furthermore, i am genrally really slack when it comes to mannageing a scrum board and offten ignore the GDD. Moreover, i find that it can be very dounting to fill a scrum board with tasks that are required to create a minimal viabal product (MVP). This is because i belive its more felexibal to work from a breif set of notes while we workout some of the unknows which might require changing. However since we lost sight of our goals, i now regret that dessision and wish i had urged for a GDD and scrum board. Furthermore, this made me feel like a failure and to be honest i was quite embarrased to show the project to reset of the cohort.

This could of been advoided if we had a GDD. In an article by Danilo Márcio Lima de Carvalho et al \cite{j4-c1}, details a genrall overview of a GDD for short projects. They state it should include the very basics shuch as project name, genre, technologies and target audience. They continue by describing that an overview of the envirment and high-level narrative and plot should be included along with how the gameplay should function. They further note that the document should be as concise as possible and include visual references to help the reader imagin the game. 

Secondly, had we planed our spint and created a scrum board to mannage our progess, we most likly would not of forgoten many points that needed implmenting. Sprint planning is an importent part of software development. The purpose of the event is to define what can be achive in the time frame. Furthermore, when using user stories \cite{} it give a team a way to determin wheather or not a task is complete. A typical user storie consistes of 'As a <type of user>, i want <a goal> so that <a reason>' which makes it farly ovbious when the task it complete (can that user type achive that goal for that reasion). However as a programmer i offten avoid user stoires as i find there is a lot of overlap in tasks. With that said i now think that the benifits outweigh the negatives, especially when considering the intire team.

I told myself that on the next project if no one steps up to take on the role i would be streaigh in there, now i relise how importent these documents are for group project. Upon starting the next project i put a lot of emphise on project management, to incurrage the team to follow protocol. Once we had our idea and was happy with what we wanted to make it was the first thing we did befor we created any assets for the game and that project turned out to be a huge success.

# A/B Testing

For our last project in the module, we where asked to come up with ideas releating to culture and society. Furthermore, we had to come up with somthing tecnical that we would like to create, then put all our ideas into a "pool of ideas" to then form teams from. I ended up joining another group, since they had a strong idea to create, a punk rock theamed street fighter game \cite{STREET FIGHTER}, which uses Guirtur Hero controlers \cite{GUIRTUR HERO} and it would be ilastrated using pixle art.

During our initial planning sessions, we came up with two different controller schemes (CS), which would later be know as the "casule CS" and the "punk CS". The "casule CS" used the top button to jump, the next three buttons down are used to attack and the bottom button to crouch, while strum is used to move \figure{CS2}. On the other hand, the "punk CS" uses the top button to move forwards and the bottom button to move backwards, while you held one of the middle three button and strumed to active an attack, to jump or crounch to just strumed up or down respectivly \figgure{CS1}. 

As a team we could'ent come to an aggrement on witch scheme to use since there was a fair arggument for both although we where leaning more toward to "casule CS". So we decided it would be best to put it the player and do some A/B testing \cite{AB_TESTING}, which is somethink i have never done befor. Once it was implermented into the game, we managed to recruite around twenty people to play test the two controller schemes. The responce we got from the play testing wasent nessesarly what we expected.

What we expected was, that most people would prefer the "casule CS" however what we found was that the more serirus players and thoes with experance with Guirtur hero like the protencal of the "punk CS". Furthermore they also found it was satifying to hold an attack button and strum to activate it. However some players did fine some protental issues with the scheme shuch as, its very hard to preform jump, attack combos since its strum up to jump and you have to strum again while holding an action button to active the attack. We also found that in genrall everyone liked how responive attack where with the "casule CS" and all-in-all was prefered by the more casule players and thoses with less experance with Guitar Hero. Furthermore, we found that players with smaller hands found it differcult to switch between move buttons on the "punk CS" or the jump, crouch buttons on the "casule CS". 

At first i found it was quite a lot of work to implerment the two controller shemes. However, affter the welth of information we collected during the play test session i now understand how valubale A/B testing really is. It was a very uplifing and therefor pleasent experance, with lots of lessions learned. It confirmed that we are somthing with the "punk CS" and we will continue to develop the controler scheme in GAM703 along with doing more A/B testing.
