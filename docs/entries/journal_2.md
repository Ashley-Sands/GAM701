On Thursday, last week, we where put into pairs and set our second short project, to remediation an existing pice media. It was'nt my fines day as we talked about in the privous post, as i woke up late and had to pretty much leave as soon as possible. Under caffinated and lacking creativaty, motivation and inspration. The workshop itself was fine (apart from forgeting my avatar), except i dont fell i fully antisapate the topics disscused, due to a lack of food and caffine. By the end i littaly just had food on the mind (i think some people call this being hangry) which further happered my inspration, creativaty and motivation (though i was very motivated to get food). Therfor, i dont feel I had a full understanding of the task at hand (on reflection).

For the last 15-20 minutes of the workshop we got into our pairs and discussed possible remediation projects. We both agreed that we would like to do somthink regarding music from the start, and began discussing ideas. Pretty erly on in the disscusion, [Drude - Standstome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6120QOlsfU) was mentioned and we both kind of got stuck on that idea and start throughing ideas out in regards to was we could do with that track inparticular. The person i was working with, Jeanett, mentioned some alturnative version of the track, suck as the [rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNDwcPB3HLY), [8-bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4ERRGkGtpo) and [folk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAqo2N06e3w) versions of the track. Which made me think, 'would'ent it be cool if you could explore a little world, as you enter areas of the world a different version of the song will be mixxed in, allowing the user/player to create there own remix of all the different versions'. We both decided the scene should be set in the desart, however, i dident really consider how i could actulay achive the technical asspect of idea, nor did we discuss how the audio clips would need to be formated. At this point it was the end of the lecture/workshop, we proberly should of stayed to develop the idea further but i really needed food as i could no longer think clearly, so i made a break for it at the first instance (politly).

Althout this is a form of remediation, i can't help but feel that we maybe missed the point a little in regards to the biref as it dident really improve upon or remedy old technologies, but rather incorerarted two forms of media into a single media, refered to as hypermedia [()[#c1]]. Furthermore, we never relly discussed weather or not to take an immediacy [()[#c2]] or hypermediacy [()[#c3]] approch to the project.

The next day i setout to start building the world and programming the macanhics for the game. But while doing so i relized that we had maybe missed the point a bit, which further incressed my procrasternation cycles and made me worroy about what we where actully going to do and justfy the slight misunderstanding. Furthermore, it streanthened my creativit block that iv been experancing and eventuly i quit the aplication in a bit of a panic as i begain to feel overwhelmed, with not knowing what to do.

The following day, i relized i had to get my act together and began by breaking down what we already know down into a more structured list of ideas and tasks that could be digested much more easerly, rather than the mess in my head. The overral process helped me to organise the concept in my head and turn it into an actule achavable project (with in the time constrats). Furthermore, by having a list of tasks, helped me focus on what needed to be done and reduced my procrasernation, since i now had a set of objectives that i know i could achive.

Throughout that process i also tock the time to consider the reasions behind my procasternation as surgested by the TEDx talk (mentioned in the privious post). Which talks a lot about the releation that self-worth and fear of failure has with procasternation. This made me further reflect on the stuff i talked about in the first post of this series, about (the frustrations of being dyslixic)[./journal_0]. But as we disscused in that post, dyslixar is'ent a limitation but a challange to overcome and i strongly belive that i can achive what i want to regardless of being dyslixic. So i concluded that this wasent the reason behind my procasternation. Which made dig even deeper into how i feeling and soon relised that i was extreamly anxious about returning to university. But what was causing the anxiety in the first place? Well, to be honest it never really sunk in that i was returning for a 4 year to complete a masters in AI and therefor not mentterly prepared. Furthermore, over the 4 month summer break i dident really develop anything, just enjoyed the much needed time off. However, this made me recognise that i was anxious in regards to getting back into the flow of development. This was making me question myself. 'What if i cant get back into development?', well... 'You'll fail', *so do know what, i'll procasternate (subconsciously)*. 

This is very much in line with the theroy disscussed in the TEDx talk. It give the perfect excuse for failure without blaming you'r own ability. I know i can develop games and application, so that cant be the reson failure, but the fact of being distracted can be. Therefor, i belive procasternation could possibley be a 'self-protection' method from my personal experances (i had a simular experance when writing my dissertation). So i began to resaon with myself, that if i can just get through this small project, it will show (myself) that i can still develop software and therefor get back into it. I also reasoned that it dident really matter that we had protencaly missed the point of biref, it more of an ice breaker project and anyway the module is more about the reflection process rather than creating amazing and highly polished applications. 

With these reliseations, i shifed my focuse back over to the to-do list and started tackerling each task one at time (not that you can really do any more at once), rewarding myself with a short break inbetween objectives. Befor i know it, i'd become relatively focuse on the tasks at hand and i actully started to enjoy myself now i had clear objectives! Over the remaing 3 days of the project i started to become more motavated and the brain fog has began to clear. Now im looking forwards to working on the next small project, thats been set today.

Anyway here's what we made, it doent quite hit the points of the biref and i dont really care anymore. I enjoyed myself create this little project (its not my finest), it boart a little smile to others in the cohort and all-in-all we all had a good giggle. Thats the importent part and why i got into developing games in the first place, to bring joy to others aswell as myself. We accoplished that with the project, so it was nothing other than a success!
